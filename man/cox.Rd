\description{
This is the data of a replication study performed by J. Wissink, G. Hoogendoorn, H. Brohmer, M. Verschoor, J. Krijnen, and M. Zeelenberg as part of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The target of replication was the finding in Experiment 6 of Cox et al. (2008) that participants who scored low on avoidance but high on anxiety demonstrated an increased relative preference for a parent after mortality salience as opposed to dental pain, b = -32.04, SE = 14.47, t = -2.22, p = .03.
