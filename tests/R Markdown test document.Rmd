```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(tidystats)
library(stringr)
```

### Setup

Start by reading in the data frame containing the output of all the statistical models.

```{r get_results, message = FALSE}
results <- read_stats("results.csv")
```

### Reporting results

The `tidystats` function to report statistics is `report()`. This function consists of two necessary arguments:

- `results`: The list containing the output of the statistical models
- `identifier`: The identifier of the model you want to report

In some cases you also need to supply a term. Some (if not most) statistical models consist of multiple terms, so you need to provide the specific term you want to report, using the `term` argument.

By default the function will return all of the required statistics to report in APA style. Optionally, you can also ask for just one specific statistic by using the `statistic` argument.

### Supported statistical tests

We currently support the following statistical tests:

- t-tests

### Examples

#### t-tests

We currently support 4 different t-tests, tested on Student's sleep data. The output is shown in the table below.

```{r}
stats_list_to_df(results) %>%
  filter(str_detect(method, "t-test")) %>%
  select(identifier, method, estimate, statistic, df_error, p_value, type) %>%
  kable()
```

A complete line of APA output can be produced using `report(results, "M1_1")`. Examples of four different t-tests are listed below.

- One Sample *t*-test: `r report(results, "M1_1")`
- Two Sample *t*-test: `r report(results, "M1_2")`
- Welch's Two Sample *t*-test: `r report(results, "M1_3")`
- Paired *t*-test: `r report(results, "M1_4")`
