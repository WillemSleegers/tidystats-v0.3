```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(tidystats)
```

## Setup

Start by reading in the data frame containing the output of all the statistical models.

```{r get_results, message = FALSE}
results <- read_stats("results.csv")
```

Let's print the results to a table.

```{r}
results %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  select(identifier, method, estimate, df, statistic, p_value) %>%
  kable()
```

## Report t-test

We currently support 4 different t-tests, tested on Student's sleep data:

- One Sample *t*-test: `r report_t_test(results, "M1_1")`
- Two Sample *t*-test: `r report_t_test(results, "M1_2")`
- Welch's Two Sample *t*-test: `r report_t_test(results, "M1_3")`
- Paired *t*-test: `r report_t_test(results, "M1_4")`

## Report correlations

We currently support 3 different t-tests, tested on some random data:

- Pearson's product-moment correlation: `r report_correlation(results, "M2_1")`
- Kendall's rank correlation tau: `r report_correlation(results, "M2_2")`
- Spearman's rank correlation rho: `r report_correlation(results, "M2_3")`
