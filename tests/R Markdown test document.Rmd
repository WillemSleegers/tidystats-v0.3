```

## Setup

Start by reading in the data frame containing the output of all the statistical models.

```{r get_results, message=FALSE}
results <- read_csv("results.csv")
```

Let's print the results to a table.

`r kable(results)`

## Report t-test

In our tests we conducted an independent t-test on Student's sleep data. We tested whether there was a difference between the two groups in how much extra sleep they got. The results show that this was not the case, `r report_t_test(results, "M1")`.
