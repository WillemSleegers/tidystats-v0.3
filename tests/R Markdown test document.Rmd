## Setup

Start by reading in the data frame containing the output of all the statistical models.

```{r get_results, message=FALSE}
results <- read_csv("results.csv")
```

Let's print the results to a table.

```{r}
results %>%
  select(identifier, method, estimate, parameter, statistic, p_value, effect_size) %>%
  kable()
```

## Report t-test

In our tests we conducted an independent t-test on Student's sleep data. We tested whether there was a difference between the two groups in how much extra sleep they got. The results show that this was not the case, `r report_t_test(results, "M1_1")`. Also if variances are assumed to be equal, there was no effect, `r report_t_test(results, "M1_2")`. However, the data was actually from a within-subjects design, so we should conduct a paired t-test! This does reveal a significant difference, `r report_t_test(results, "M2")`.

## Report correlation

We tested for a correlation between two vectors; but we haven't implemented a report correlation function yet so we can't show you the results yet!
